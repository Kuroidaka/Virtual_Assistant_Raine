The Mohist philosophy believes that every human being is valued equally in the eyes of heaven, and that partiality in care, or thinking that one group of people has greater value than another, leads to aggression, wars, and lack of respect among individuals, families, and nations. The doctrines promote the idea of inclusive care, which is the cause of benefit and moral goodness, while condemning aggression and partial care as the cause of harm. These doctrines aim to improve social order, harmony, and the well-being of all individuals by advocating for universal care and condemning aggression.","Global skepticism questions the possibility of all knowledge, while local skepticism questions the possibility of knowledge only in specific areas of study. Global skeptics argue that certainty is not possible in our beliefs, therefore knowledge in general is not possible. Local skeptics, on the other hand, may question the possibility of knowledge in domains such as religion or morality, without rejecting the possibility of knowledge in other areas.","Nietzsche views the basis for morality as a reversal of traditional Judeo-Christian philosophy. He believes that in this system, the \\"good\\" is represented by powerlessness and is a spiritual virtue, while the \\"evil\\" is represented by strength and is a spiritual vice. Nietzsche sees this reversal as a tragic and dangerous trick that allows the weak to stifle the power of the strong and hinder the progress of humanity.","The two different ways of conceptualizing belief structures are as a web of interconnected beliefs and as a linear structure in which foundational beliefs justify other beliefs, one after the other in a line.","Socrates&#x27;s method of gaining knowledge was through questioning others rather than explaining his own beliefs. This method, known as the Socratic method, involved asking questions and examining the claims made by another person in order to assist them in discovering the truth on their own.","Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms or supports prior beliefs or values. It is the tendency to only seek out evidence that aligns with our existing beliefs and ignore or dismiss information that contradicts them.","According to Mary Anne Warren, the five fundamental traits that define the notion of personhood are consciousness (specifically the capacity to feel pain), reasoning (the ability to solve complex problems), self-awareness and self-concepts, self-motivated and self-directed activity, and the capacity to communicate messages that are not limited in terms of content, topic, or type.","Traditional Western philosophies perceive the instrumental value of nature as having value solely as a means to satisfy human needs and desires. In other words, nature is seen as a resource that can be used by humans to achieve their goals and fulfill their desires. This perspective is rooted in anthropocentrism, which is the belief that humans are the center of moral consideration and that human interests take precedence over the interests of the natural world.","Harry G. Frankfurt argues that freedom should be understood not as the ability to do otherwise, but as the ability to do what one wants. He presents a thought experiment involving a deranged space alien who presents a choice to either eat a delicious pizza or press a button that will annihilate Earth. In this scenario, Frankfurt suggests that even though one may not have the ability to do otherwise (pressing the button would result in the destruction of Earth), they can still be considered free if they are acting in accordance with their own desires and wants. Frankfurt&#x27;s argument challenges the idea that freedom is contingent upon having alternative possibilities.","The fundamental divergence between the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle concerning the concepts of forms and individual instances is their understanding of the relationship between them. Plato believed that forms were the ultimate reality and existed outside of our earthly realm. He argued that individual instances were mere reflections or imperfect copies of these forms. In contrast, Aristotle emphasized the importance of individual instances and asserted that without them, there could be no knowledge of the form. He believed that the form was embedded within particular matter and that the ultimate reality was within each instance of matter observed.","The central premise of the teleological argument as proposed by William Paley is that the intricate details and design observed in nature imply the existence of a creator. Paley argues that when we observe the complexity and purposeful arrangement of living organisms and the order displayed on a cosmological scale, it is unreasonable to believe that these could have occurred by chance.\\n\\nTo illustrate his point, Paley uses an analogy between the design of a watch and the design of the universe. He asks us to imagine finding a watch on a beach. Upon examining the watch, we would see the intricate gears, coils, and springs that work together to make it function. We would naturally conclude that the watch was designed and crafted by an intelligent watchmaker, rather than attributing its existence to chance.\\n\\nPaley then extends this analogy to the natural world. He argues that just as the complexity and purposeful arrangement of the watch imply the existence of a watchmaker, the complexity and purposeful arrangement of living organisms and the universe imply the existence of a creator. The level of design and order observed in nature is so intricate and precise that it cannot be the result of random chance. Therefore, Paley concludes that there must be a creator responsible for this design, which he identifies as God.\\n\\nIn summary, Paley&#x27;s teleological argument asserts that the intricate details and design observed in nature suggest the existence of a creator, similar to how the design of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker.","Augustine believed that all of God&#x27;s creation was inherently good. He rejected the idea that anything in God&#x27;s creation was evil. According to Augustine, even things that appeared evil to humans were actually part of God&#x27;s providential plan. This included Satan&#x27;s rebellion, which Augustine saw as a part of God&#x27;s overall plan.\\n\\nIn terms of free will, Augustine acknowledged the existence of human freedom but also recognized the omniscience of an all-powerful God. He grappled with the question of how to reconcile individual human freedom with God&#x27;s knowledge of all things. Augustine argued that while humans have the power to choose between good and evil, it is ultimately divine grace that can resolve the conflict between these two rival wills. He believed that it is within our power to choose the good, despite the original sin of Adam and Eve. However, the ultimate resolution of this conflict requires divine intervention.\\n\\nIn summary, Augustine&#x27;s perspective on the nature of good and evil within God&#x27;s creation emphasized that everything created by God is inherently good. He saw evil as the absence of good rather than a separate entity. Augustine also recognized the existence of human freedom but believed that divine grace is necessary to ultimately resolve the conflict between good and evil.","The primary emphasis of Goldman&#x27;s epistemological theory is on the reliability of belief-forming processes in the formation and justification of beliefs. According to Goldman, beliefs are justified if they are produced by reliable processes that reliably produce true beliefs. These reliable processes include perception, memory, strong reasoning, and introspection. The focus is on the causal factors that lead to the formation of beliefs, rather than the ability of the believer to recount the justification process.","Aristotle suggests that Thales believed water to be the fundamental and enduring element of existence based on several observations. Thales observed that all things are nourished through water, that heat is generated through the absence or removal of water, and that all things require water to live. These observations led Thales to conclude that water is essential for the existence and sustenance of all beings. Aristotle also notes that Thales believed that material elements have a fundamental connection to water in terms of their capacity to move and alter their state. Thales distinguished between material elements that participate in change and elements that have their own internal source of motion, such as the magnet and amber. Overall, Thales&#x27; belief in water as the fundamental element of existence was based on empirical observations and the understanding of the natural world during his time.","The two controversial moral principles that Socrates firmly believes in are:\\n\\n1) No one willingly chooses what is harmful to themselves.\\n2) When a person does harm to others, they actually harm themselves.","The Euthyphro problem is a philosophical challenge that arises in the context of theistic ethical systems, particularly in relation to the divine command theory. It questions the relationship between morality and the commands of God. The problem is named after the Platonic dialogue \\"Euthyphro,\\" where Socrates engages in a conversation with a man named Euthyphro, who claims to be an expert on piety.\\n\\nThe dilemma can be summarized by the following question: Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good? In other words, is morality determined by God&#x27;s commands, or are God&#x27;s commands determined by an independent standard of goodness?\\n\\nIf something is good because God commands it, then morality becomes arbitrary and subjective. It implies that whatever God commands is automatically considered good, regardless of the content or consequences of those commands. This raises concerns about the nature of morality and the possibility of moral reasoning.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if God commands something because it is good, then morality exists independently of God&#x27;s commands. This suggests that there is a higher standard of goodness that even God must adhere to. This raises questions about the nature of God&#x27;s authority and omnipotence.\\n\\nThe Euthyphro problem presents an ethical dilemma because it challenges the foundation of moral values in theistic ethical systems. It forces us to consider whether ethics are an expression of the divine or if they can be understood separately from divine authority. It also raises questions about the nature of morality and the relationship between God and moral principles.","To improve concentration and understanding of complex philosophical material, it is recommended to prepare your reading space in the following ways:\\n\\n1. Choose a table with a comfortable chair: Sitting at a table with a comfortable chair instead of on a couch or in a bed will help you maintain a more focused and alert posture, which can enhance concentration.\\n\\n2. Minimize distractions: Avoid distractions such as the TV or music with lyrics. Create a quiet environment that allows you to fully engage with the reading material.\\n\\n3. Have something to drink nearby: Having a drink nearby can help keep you hydrated and prevent interruptions to get up and get a drink.\\n\\n4. Use an annotation tool: Choose a text that you can alter, such as a digital document or a physical book that allows you to write notes, underline, and flag important portions of the reading. This will help you actively engage with the material and make it easier to review later.\\n\\nBy implementing these strategies, you can create a conducive reading space that promotes concentration and understanding of complex philosophical material.","Standpoint theorists would argue that focusing on the perspectives of traditionally marginalized groups is crucial in understanding and creating a just society, as it allows for a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of social structures, behaviors, and power dynamics. By centering the experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups, standpoint theorists believe that we can gain insights and knowledge that would otherwise be overlooked or ignored if we only focus on the perspectives of privileged groups. This is because marginalized groups often have a unique and more critical understanding of the power dynamics and injustices they face, which can provide valuable insights into the workings of society. For example, in Plato&#x27;s &#x27;Republic&#x27;, standpoint theorists might argue that by including the perspectives of women, enslaved individuals, and other marginalized groups, we can gain a deeper understanding of the inequalities and injustices present in the ideal city-state and work towards addressing them.","The Principle of Charity would be applied in interpreting Anselm&#x27;s writings on the existence of God and the nature of good by interpreting his statements in the most rational and best way possible. This means giving him the benefit of the doubt and assuming that he is making logical and coherent arguments, even if his language or terminology may be unclear or ambiguous. It involves trying to understand his intended meaning and purpose behind his arguments, rather than jumping to uncharitable interpretations or dismissing his ideas outright.","The Dunning-Kruger effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals with low competence or knowledge in a particular subject tend to overestimate their own abilities, while highly competent individuals tend to underestimate their abilities. In the context of philosophical studies, this effect can have a significant impact on understanding philosophical concepts.\\n\\nNovices or individuals with limited knowledge in philosophy may mistakenly believe that they have a deep understanding of philosophical concepts and may overestimate their own competence. This can lead to a false sense of confidence and a reluctance to engage in further learning or critical thinking. As a result, they may fail to recognize the complexity and depth of philosophical ideas and may struggle to grasp the nuances and subtleties of philosophical arguments.\\n\\nOn the other hand, experts in philosophy may underestimate their own abilities due to their awareness of the vastness and complexity of the subject. They may have a more accurate understanding of their own limitations and the depth of knowledge required to truly comprehend philosophical concepts. This humility can be beneficial as it encourages experts to continue learning and exploring different perspectives.\\n\\nThe Dunning-Kruger effect in philosophical studies can hinder the development of a deep and nuanced understanding of philosophical concepts. It is important for individuals to be aware of this effect and approach their studies with humility and a willingness to continuously learn and grow. By recognizing their own limitations and being open to different perspectives, individuals can overcome the potential impact of the Dunning-Kruger effect and enhance their understanding of philosophical concepts.","Based on the document, there is no mention of the influence of the philosophical understanding of &#x27;reality&#x27; and &#x27;truth&#x27; on the main areas of debate in bioethics. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the question based on the given information.","Based on the provided information, there is no direct mention of gender binarism or intersectionality in relation to the ethical obligations of software engineers as stated in the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how these concepts specifically influence the ethical obligations of software engineers in this context.","The author of the book \\"But Is It Art? An Introduction to Art Theory\\" is Cynthia Freeland.","In the context of Henry Odera Oruka&#x27;s study of philosophic thoughts of sages in modern-day Kenya, foundationalism could potentially apply to their belief systems in the sense that they may have certain basic beliefs that serve as the foundation for their overall philosophical framework. These basic beliefs could be seen as the starting point from which their other beliefs and philosophical ideas are derived. However, without further information about the specific beliefs and ideas of the sages interviewed in the study, it is difficult to provide a more detailed analysis of how foundationalism might apply to their belief systems.","A strong inductive inference is one that is supported by strong and reliable evidence. It is explanatory, simple, conservative, and has depth. On the other hand, a weak inductive inference is one that is supported by weak or insufficient evidence. The evidence may be too narrow or focused on one type of evidence, or it may be flawed in some way. In the case of Aristotle&#x27;s writings about unicorns, if his inference that unicorns exist is based on limited or unreliable evidence, it would be considered a weak inductive inference.","All conditionals consist of two components: the \\"if\\" component and the \\"then\\" component.","The three great philosophers of classical philosophy were Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.","According to the philosophy material, the main characteristic of a city of excellence is the establishment of a social order based on positive character, virtuous behavior, and moral action. In such a city, the citizens embody these principles and encourage others to do the same, resulting in a harmonious society where all inhabitants can achieve their greatest possible level of happiness and fulfillment.","Saint Augustine&#x27;s argument in response to the problem of evil was that evil is not a positive existence, but rather the absence or privation of good. He argued that God, as the creator of all things, is inherently good and cannot be challenged as being good if evil exists. Augustine believed that evil was a result of human free will and that even Satan&#x27;s rebellion was part of God&#x27;s providential plan. He sought to reconcile the existence of evil with the concept of an all-powerful God by asserting that evil is not a flaw in the design of the cosmos, but rather a necessary reflection of the existence of God.","The main areas of bioethical debate according to the philosophers include abortion, euthanasia, and clinical trials.","The concept of distributive justice refers to the fair distribution of resources, wealth, and opportunities within a society. It involves determining how goods and services should be allocated among individuals and groups, taking into account factors such as need, merit, and equality. The question of distributive justice explores whether a just society should prioritize meeting the needs of its disadvantaged members or allow for greater personal freedom, even if it leads to unequal outcomes.","Based on the document, here\\u2019s the difference between compatibilism and incompatibilism in the context of determinism:\\n\\nCompatibilism, or soft determinism, posits that free will and determinism can coexist. Compatibilists argue that even if our actions are determined by external forces or natural laws, we can still be morally responsible for our choices and actions. They believe that freedom is about acting in accordance with our own desires and motivations, not necessarily having alternative possibilities.\\n\\nOn the other hand, incompatibilism asserts that free will and determinism are not compatible. Incompatibilists argue that if our actions are determined by external forces or natural laws, we cannot truly have free will. They believe that for an action to be free, it must be undetermined and not causally determined by external factors. Therefore, if determinism is true, our actions are predetermined, and we cannot be held morally responsible for them.\\n\\nIn summary, compatibilism believes in the coexistence of free will and determinism, while incompatibilism argues that they are fundamentally incompatible.","Mary Gregor translated and edited Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &#x27;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&#x27;.","The basis of Utilitarianism is the principle of utility, which states that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness and wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. Utilitarians argue that moral conduct is conduct that maximizes the good or produces the most value. They identify happiness with utility and believe that pleasure and pain are the primary means by which people navigate the world and find motivation. The goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize happiness for the greatest number of people.","The general moral guidance of Daoism, according to the Dao Dejing, involves becoming aware of the Dao, or the natural way of things, and ensuring that one&#x27;s actions don&#x27;t oppose those natural forces. Daoism seeks to foster harmony in both society and the individual by living life in accordance with what is natural.","Based on the document, here&#x27;s a good strategy to build paragraphs in a philosophical argument:\\n\\n1. **Start with a topic sentence**: Begin each paragraph with a clear and concise topic sentence that states the main point or argument you will be discussing in that paragraph.\\n\\n2. **Provide evidence**: Support your argument with evidence from primary and secondary sources. This can include quotations, paraphrases, and references to relevant texts or research.\\n\\n3. **Context and interpretation**: Provide context and interpretation for the evidence you present. Explain how the evidence supports your argument and how it relates to the broader philosophical concepts or theories you are discussing.\\n\\n4. **Present novel thoughts and ideas**: Offer your own insights and analysis in addition to the evidence. This can include original arguments, interpretations, or connections you make between different ideas or sources.\\n\\n5. **Address counterarguments**: Acknowledge and address potential counterarguments to your position. This shows that you have considered alternative viewpoints and strengthens your argument by demonstrating its resilience.\\n\\n6. **Reply to counterarguments**: Respond to the counterarguments you have presented by providing further evidence or reasoning to support your position. Explain why the counterarguments are not persuasive or how your argument outweighs them.\\n\\n7. **Build towards the conclusion**: Each paragraph should contribute to the overall development of your argument and build towards your conclusion. Make sure that the ideas and evidence presented in each paragraph logically connect to the next.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can create well-structured paragraphs that effectively present and support your philosophical argument.","Divine command theory is the idea that moral principles are determined by the commands of a higher power, typically God. In this ethical framework, the concept of God functions as the ultimate authority and source of moral guidance. God&#x27;s commands are seen as the basis for determining what is right and wrong, and humans are obligated to follow these commands. The concept of God can also serve as an exemplar for the virtues and values that should guide human action. Additionally, God can be viewed as an ultimate judge who decides what is morally right or wrong from a position of omnipotence and infallibility.","Based on the document, the source of information about the caste system in India is not provided. However, the translator of the &#x27;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844&#x27; by Karl Marx is Martin Milligan.","Realism is a philosophical position that asserts the existence of objective truths or facts about the world. In the context of ethics, moral realism holds that ethical values and principles are grounded in objective realities and are not merely subjective opinions. It argues that there is a moral truth that can be discovered through reasoning and objective frameworks.\\n\\nOn the other hand, moral anti-realism is the philosophical position that ethical values are not based on objective facts about the world. Instead, it suggests that moral values rely on subjective foundations such as individual desires and beliefs. Anti-realism denies the existence of objective moral truths and argues that moral values are relative or subjective.\\n\\nIn summary, moral realism believes in the existence of objective moral truths, while moral anti-realism denies the existence of such truths and considers moral values to be subjective.","Based on the document provided, the information does not include the specific details about the editors of the &#x27;Encyclopedia of Philosophy&#x27; or the authors of the paper &#x27;Employment-at-Will, Employee Rights, and Future Directions for Employment&#x27;.","The founder of Mohism was Mo Di or Mozi. The central tenets of Mohism can be summarized by the ten doctrines that form the core of early Mohism:\\n\\n1. \\"Promoting the Worthy\\" and \\"Identifying Upward\\": Emphasizing a meritocratic system where individuals are appointed to positions based on their performance and moral goodness.\\n\\n2. \\"Inclusive Care\\" and \\"Condemning Aggression\\": Advocating for universal love and benevolence towards all people, while condemning acts of aggression and violence.\\n\\n3. \\"Moderation in Use\\" and \\"Moderation in Burial\\": Promoting the idea of using resources and wealth in a balanced and moderate way, as well as advocating for simplicity and frugality in burial practices.\\n\\n4. \\"Heaven&#x27;s Intent\\" and \\"Understanding Ghosts\\": Believing in the existence of a divine will or cosmic order, and seeking to understand and align with it. Also, recognizing the existence of spirits and the importance of understanding and respecting them.\\n\\n5. \\"Condemning Music\\" and \\"Condemning Fatalism\\": Criticizing excessive indulgence in music and entertainment, and rejecting the belief in predestined fate.\\n\\nThese doctrines reflect Mohism&#x27;s emphasis on rationality, ethical principles, social harmony, and the pursuit of the greater good for all.","The main difference between act and rule utilitarianism is that act utilitarians believe that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences in a specific situation, while rule utilitarians believe that the morality of an action is determined by whether it follows a general rule that, if consistently followed, would lead to the greatest overall happiness.\\n\\nGood will is important in Kant&#x27;s ethics because Kant argues that a good will is the only thing that is unconditionally good. Good will is not determined by the consequences of an action or by personal desires, but rather by the intention behind the action. Kant believes that acting out of a sense of duty and moral obligation, rather than self-interest or inclination, is what makes an action morally good. Good will is seen as the foundation of moral action in Kant&#x27;s ethics.","The term \\"bioethics\\" was coined by Van Rensselaer Potter in 1970. Bioethics is a field that studies ethical issues that arise with advances in biology, technology, and medicine. Some of the contemporary ethical issues in bioethics include abortion, euthanasia, clinical trials, and human augmentation.","Bertrand Russell&#x27;s argument about broken clocks is that even if a man looks at a stopped clock at the correct time and acquires a true belief about the time, he cannot be said to have knowledge of the correct time. Russell concludes this because the man&#x27;s belief is only a matter of luck, as the clock is not working and the man happens to look at it at the moment when it is right. Therefore, Russell argues that true belief alone is not sufficient for knowledge.","The two common types of inferences in philosophy are deductive and inductive inferences. Deductive inferences guarantee the truth of their conclusions when valid, while inductive inferences offer probable support for the conclusion when strong. \\n\\nIn an argument, truth and logic are separate features that are assessed. Truth analysis involves determining whether the statements or premises of an argument are correct or accurate. Logical analysis, on the other hand, assesses whether the premises of an argument support the conclusion. While truth analysis focuses on the correctness of the statements, logical analysis focuses on the reasoning process and whether the inference supports the conclusion. In philosophy, logical analysis is often treated as primary because it helps to determine the validity of arguments, especially in subjects where determining the truth is difficult.","The controversy about the origins of classical thought revolves around the influence of Egyptian scholarship on classical Greek philosophy. Some argue that Greek beliefs, religious practices, and understanding of the natural world can be traced back to Egypt. Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, claimed that the roots of classical thought lie, at least in part, in Egypt. He traced Greek beliefs about the gods, religious practices, and understanding of the natural world to Egypt.","I&#x27;m sorry, but I cannot provide the definition from the uploaded file as it does not contain any definitions.","The two methods proposed to gather knowledge are rationalism and empiricism. Rationalism suggests that knowledge can be acquired through reason alone, without relying on experience. Empiricism, on the other hand, argues that knowledge is gained through empirical methods, including direct and indirect observation and experience.","The main difference between act and rule utilitarianism is that act utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of individual actions, while rule utilitarianism focuses on following general rules that promote the greatest overall happiness.","The main differences between the three main areas of ethics are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Metaethics**: Metaethics deals with the nature of ethics itself. It explores questions about the meaning of moral terms, the objectivity of moral values, and the nature of moral judgments. It is concerned with understanding the foundations and principles of ethics.\\n\\n2. **Normative Ethics**: Normative ethics focuses on providing guidelines for determining what is morally right or wrong. It seeks to establish moral standards and principles that can be used to evaluate actions and behaviors. Normative ethics is concerned with answering questions about how we should act and what moral obligations we have.\\n\\n3. **Applied Ethics**: Applied ethics applies ethical theories and principles to specific real-life situations and issues. It involves the practical application of ethical principles to areas such as medicine, business, politics, and the environment. Applied ethics aims to address ethical dilemmas and provide guidance for making ethical decisions in specific contexts.\\n\\nIn summary, metaethics examines the nature of ethics, normative ethics provides guidelines for determining right and wrong, and applied ethics applies ethical principles to real-life situations.","Based on the following document search results to answer user: \\nThe extracted parts of the document discuss various philosophical questions and concepts, such as the relationship between general terms and specific things, the practical approach to knowledge and distinctions, the application of philosophical ideas in personal life and society, and the nature of intuitive truths based on definitions, mental operations, and commonly accepted knowledge.","Based on the extracted parts of the document, it is not clear who the question is referring to.

These basic beliefs are considered to be non-inferential, meaning they are not based on inference from other beliefs. The justification for these basic beliefs is often argued to be their infallibility, meaning they cannot be mistaken. However, the question of what justifies these basic beliefs is a point of contention and a strong objection against foundationalism."]],["reference_answer",["The title of the book by Marcus Aurelius mentioned in the context is &#x27;Meditations: The Annotated Edition&#x27;.","Foot argues that part of understanding what an organism is involves knowing what is good for it based on its vital processes. For example, you know what is good for a duck based on knowledge of what a duck is. This knowledge would include an understanding of the duck\\u2019s nature and what helps it live a good life. Similarly, you can know what is good for a human based on knowledge of human nature.","In the first chapter of Laozi&#x27;s Daodejing, the Tao is described as enduring and unchanging. It is stated that the Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. It is also referred to as the Originator of heaven and earth when conceived as having no name, and the Mother of all things when conceived as having a name.","Following the Spanish conquest of the territory, Catholic priests burned almost all of the Maya codices as well as their scientific and technical manuals.","The &#x27;Inclusive Care&#x27; and &#x27;Condemning Aggression&#x27; doctrines affirm the importance of considering and caring for social order and harmony.","Global skepticism is the view that questions the possibility of all knowledge. It points to the lack of the possibility of certainty in our beliefs. Because we cannot know that our beliefs are true, we cannot know in general. On the other hand, a local skeptic questions the possibility of knowledge only in particular areas of study. One can be a local skeptic about moral knowledge or scientific knowledge.","Friedrich Nietzsche rejected God as a basis for morality and asserted that there is no longer (and never was) any ground for morality other than the human.","There are two different ways of conceptualizing belief structures: as a web of interconnected beliefs and as a linear structure in which foundational beliefs justify other beliefs, one after the other in a line.","Socrates&#x27;s method of gaining knowledge was to engage in dialectics with others.","Confirmation bias is one of the most common cognitive biases, which is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms or supports your prior beliefs.","The five characteristics essential to the concept of personhood according to Mary Anne Warren are: Consciousness (in particular, the capacity to feel pain), Reasoning (the developed capacity to solve new, complex problems), The presence of self-awareness and self-concepts, Self-motivated and self-directed activity, The capacity to communicate messages that are not definite or limited in terms of possible content, topic, or type.","According to traditional Western philosophies, the natural world is viewed as having instrumental value, meaning that it has value solely as a means to satisfy human needs and desires.","Harry G.Frankfurt argued that freedom was better understood not as the ability to do otherwise but as the ability to do what one wants.","While Plato stressed forms and asserted that there could be no individual instance without the form, Aristotle stressed particulars and asserted that without individual instances, there could be no knowledge of the form. Plato holds that beauty itself causes the beauty we see in flowers or faces, whereas Aristotle asserts that there is no such thing as beauty without beautiful things, such as flowers and faces.","William Paley proposed a teleological argument, sometimes called the design argument, that there exists so much intricate detail, design, and purpose in the world that we must suppose a creator. The sophistication and incredible detail we observe in nature could not have occurred by chance.","Augustine held that all of creation was good simply by virtue of the fact that God had created it. Nothing in God\\u2019s creation was evil: things that appeared evil to us were all part of God\\u2019s providential plan. Even Satan\\u2019s rebellion was part of God\\u2019s plan.","Goldman\\u2019s theory of knowledge, also called historical reliabilism, focuses on the past processes that led to a belief. According to the theory, processes that reliably produce true beliefs confer justification on those beliefs. Reliable belief-forming processes include perception, memory, strong or valid reasoning, and introspection.","According to Aristotle, Thales&#x27; belief reflected the observations that all things are nourished through water, that heat itself is generated through the absence or removal of water, and that all things require water to live.","Socrates asserts two moral principles: 1) No one willingly chooses what is harmful to themselves; 2) When a person does harm to others, they actually harm themselves.","The Euthyphro problem asks whether something is good because God commands it or if God commands it because it is good.","Some tips include reading at a table with a comfortable chair instead of on a couch or in a bed, having something to drink nearby, and avoiding distractions like TV or music with lyrics. Some people find it helpful to have a little bit of bustle around them, like working in a caf\\u00e9 or library, while others find this distracting. Some people like music; others prefer silence. You should find the setting that helps you concentrate.","Standpoint theorists advocate for focusing on the perspectives of traditionally marginalized groups because it helps to understand social structures, behaviors, and relationships, especially power dynamics within social institutions. Ignoring the experiences of entire classes of people can result in an inadequate understanding. For instance, to understand racism and unequal power structures, interviewing Black citizens would generate more insightful evidence than interviews with White citizens. Similarly, women are in a better position to explain sexism within a workplace.","The principle of charity is an interpretive principle that advises the reader to interpret the author\\u2019s statements in the most rational and best way possible.","The Dunning-Kruger effect is a psychological phenomenon where incompetent people or novices rate their own knowledge of a subject more highly than they ought to, while highly competent people or experts rate their knowledge slightly lower than they ought to. Experts are fairly accurate in rating their own knowledge but they tend to assume that everyone else has a similar level of expertise. By contrast, novices consider themselves to be far more competent in comparison to others and misrepresent their own incompetence.","The main areas of bioethical debate include abortion, euthanasia, clinical trials, and human augmentation.","The ethical obligations of software engineers include a commitment to approve software only if it meets certain specifications and passes appropriate tests, is deemed safe, and does not threaten to diminish the quality of human life, impinge on privacy, or harm the environment.","The book &#x27;But Is It Art? An Introduction to Art Theory&#x27; was written by Cynthia Freeland.","Foundationalism is the view that all justified beliefs ultimately rest on a set of foundational, basic beliefs. The majority of people\\u2019s beliefs are inferential beliefs, or beliefs based on inference. If a belief is consistent with other beliefs and rests on the foundation, it is justified.","A strong inductive inference is one where, if the evidence offered is true, then the conclusion is probably true. A weak inductive inference is one where, if the evidence offered is true, the conclusion may not necessarily be true.","All conditionals include two components \\u2014that which follows the &#x27;if&#x27; and that which follows the &#x27;then.&#x27;","The three great philosophers of classical philosophy were Socrates (470\\u2013399 BCE), Plato (c. 428\\u2013347 BCE), and Aristotle (384\\u2013322 BCE).","The city of excellence is governed by the practice of the &#x27;royal craft,&#x27; or the management of political affairs. This craft attempts to establish a social order based on positive character, virtuous behavior, and moral action. When the citizens of the city embody these principles and encourage others to embody them as well, a harmonious society results, one in which all inhabitants can achieve their greatest possible level of happiness and fulfillment.","Saint Augustine argued that as God was omnibenevolent (all good), God would not introduce evil into our existence. Evil, observed Augustine, was not real. It was a privation or negation of the good. Evil therefore did not argue against the reality or being of God but was a reflection for the necessity of God.","The main areas of bioethical debate include abortion, euthanasia, clinical trials, and human augmentation.","Distributive justice can be seen as a moral framework made up of principles that seek to ensure the greatest amount of fairness with respect to distributions of wealth, goods, and services.","Compatibilism, often associated with soft determinism, assumes that free will is compatible with determinism. In other words, even if all events are determined, our actions can still be considered free as long as there are no internal constraints concerning the choice at hand. On the other hand, an incompatibilist position asserts that due to the nature of freedom and our lack of control concerning our actions, we cannot be held culpable for our actions, implying that free will is not compatible with determinism.","The &#x27;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&#x27; by Immanuel Kant was translated and edited by Mary Gregor.","The value of an action in utilitarian philosophy rests on the psychological state it causes. Utilitarians evaluate actions based on the intensity, duration, certainty, and extent of pleasure or pain and the number of people it affects. An action is considered moral if it leads to the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people.","The general moral guidance of Daoism involves becoming aware of the dao and ensuring that one\\u2019s action doesn\\u2019t oppose natural forces.","One strategy to successfully build paragraphs is to think in terms of good argument structure. You should provide adequate evidence to support the claims you want to make. Your paragraphs will consist of quotations and paraphrases from primary and secondary sources, context and interpretation, novel thoughts and ideas, examples and analogies, counterarguments, and replies to the counterarguments.","Divine command theory is the idea that piety is a command from above without reason, which limits one&#x27;s ability to theorize about it. In this ethical framework, the concept of God functions as an ultimate judge who decides what is right and wrong from an omnipotent and infallible position. Humans may disagree on what is right or wrong because of their limited perspectives, but morality is not relative or arbitrary because it rests on eternal truths from an all-knowing God.","The source of information about the caste system in India is &#x27;Jati: The Caste System in India&#x27; by Johnson, Donald, and Jean Johnson, published by the Center for Global Education, Asia Society in 2008 and the &#x27;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844&#x27; by Karl Marx was translated by an unnamed translator in 1959.","Realism is the philosophical position that asserts that ethical values have some basis in reality and require an objective framework.

It explores what constitutes virtuous behavior, arriving at ideas of universal love and benevolence. Mohists evaluate behavior according to how well it benefits others, and believe that governance should focus on promoting social welfare. The morality of an action or policy is determined by its outcome, and aggression and injury to others, even in military operations, should be opposed.","This context does not provide an answer.","The term &#x27;bioethics&#x27; was coined in 1970 by Van Rensselaer Potter, an American biochemist.

While the man acquires a true belief about the time of day, Russell concludes that he doesn&#x27;t have knowledge. This is because, despite the clock&#x27;s known reliability and the man&#x27;s justification for his belief, the clock is not working. It is only by luck that the man looks at one of the two times a day when the clock is correct, making his belief true.","The two common types of inferences in philosophy are deductive and inductive.

Truth analysis involves assessing the truth of the premises, looking for weaknesses or untruths in the premises.","The controversy about the origins of classical thought is about the extent to which these origins can be said to lie in Egypt. Martin Bernal argued that the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians played a foundational role in the formation of Greek civilization and philosophy, a claim that has been critiqued by Mary Lefkowitz. According to Herodotus, the roots of classical thought lie, at least in part, in Egypt, as he claimed that the ancient Greeks adopted practices and ideas from the Egyptians.","A global skeptic is someone who rejects the possibility of knowledge in general.","The two methods proposed by Enlightenment thinkers to gather knowledge to improve social conditions are rationalism, which regards reason as the source of most knowledge, and empiricism, which relies upon the evidence provided by experiments.","Internalism is the view that justification for belief is determined solely by factors internal to a subject\\u2019s mind. The subject must have cognitive access to the reasons for belief in order to have justification. On the other hand, externalism is the view that at least some part of justification can rely on factors that are not internal or accessible to the mind of the believer. Externalist theories about justification usually focus on the sources of justification, which include not only inference but also testimony and perception.","Confucianism focuses on character and argues that through the cultivation of virtue we perfect ourselves. Mohism focuses on consequences to determine rightness, and Mohists believe actions that promote general welfare are right. Daoism, however, supports acting against the natural way and rejects the affirmation of traditional moral norms by Mohists and Confucians. Daoists believe social norms and practices won&#x27;t solve our problems because they promote an unnatural way of life. Instead, Daoism affirms simplicity, the elimination of desires and greed, and naturalness.","Philosophers often describe pleasure as sensory or bodily, affective or emotional, and mental or intellectual. Sensory pleasure can be described as the pleasure of biting into a juicy apple, watching light reflect on water, and feeling soft textures. Affective or emotional pleasure can be described as the elation of achieving a goal, the joy of receiving good news, and the comfort of spending time with a close friend. Mental or intellectual pleasure can be described as the gratification of learning something new, the satisfaction of sharing ideas with others, and the euphoria of immersing one\\u2019s focus entirely in an activity.","Nathan Smith has been a full-time instructor of philosophy at Houston Community College (HCC) since 2008.
